# Day 16: Data Aggregation & Grouping in Pandas

In this session, I learned how to use Pandas `groupby()` for summarizing data, performing aggregation functions like mean, sum, min, max, and working with multiple group levels. I also practiced using `agg()`, `transform()`, `filter()` and resetting index for grouped data.

## Topics:
- groupby()
- Aggregation functions
- Multi-column grouping
- Using agg()
- transform() and filter()

This is an essential skill for summarizing and analyzing datasets effectively.
